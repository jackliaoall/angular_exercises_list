1. FIRSTLY FRIENDS WE NEED FRESH ANGULAR 10 SETUP AND FOR THIS WE NEED TO RUN BELOW COMMANDS BUT IF YOU ALREADY HAVE ANGULAR 10 SETUP THEN YOU CAN AVOID BELOW COMMANDS. SECONDLY WE SHOULD ALSO HAVE LATEST NODE VERSION INSTALLED ON OUR SYSTEM:
ng new youtubeplayer //Create new Angular Project
cd youtubeplayer

2. NOW FRIENDS, HERE WE NEED TO RUN BELOW COMMANDS INTO OUR PROJECT TERMINAL TO INSTALL YOUTUBE PLAYER MODULES INTO OUR ANGULAR APPLICATION:
npm install yt-player
npm install yt-player-angular

3. NOW FRIENDS WE JUST NEED TO ADD BELOW CODE INTO SRC/APP/APP.MODULE.TS FILE:
import { YtPlayerAngularModule } from 'yt-player-angular';
@NgModule({
  imports: [
    YtPlayerAngularModule
  ]
...

4. NOW FRIENDS WE JUST NEED TO ADD BELOW CODE INTO SRC/APP/APP.COMPONENT.HTML FILE:
<yt-player [videoId]="'56pfyDVG7vo'"></yt-player>
